These are errata that I found in the Second Printing from October 2012.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Page 148: *beg in second code example should be *pbeg.

* Page 150, exercise 4.6c is missing a semicolon at the end.

* Page 239, section 'constexpr Functions', third line:

  "The return type and the type of each parameter in a must be a literal
  type,..."
  
  must be

  "The return type and the type of each parameter in a constexpr function must
  be a literal type,..."

* Page 263, line 8: "As we'll, see" must be replaced by "As we'll see,"

* Page 334, Exercise 9.10: the line with it1 and it2 is probably wrong, since
  both g++ and clang give an error for this line.

* Page 387, line 6 starting from the bottom:

  "It would be move useful ..." -> "It would be more useful ..."
