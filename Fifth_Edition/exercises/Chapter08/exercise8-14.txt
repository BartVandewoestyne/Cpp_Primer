const: because we only read the information, we do not change it.
auto: because it's easy to use: we don't need to write out the whole type.
&: See Item 20 in Effective C++, Third edition:
   * Prefer pass-by-reference-to-const over pass-by-value. It's typically more
     efficient and it avoids the slicing problem.
   * The rule doesn't apply to built-in types and STL iterator and function
     object types. For them, pass-by-value is usually appropriate.
