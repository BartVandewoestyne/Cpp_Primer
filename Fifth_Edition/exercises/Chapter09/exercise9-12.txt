C c1(c2)

  To create a container as a copy of another container, the container and
  element types must match.

C c(b, e)

  When we pass iterators, there is no requirement that the container types be
  identical.  Moreover, the element types in the new and original containers can
  differ as long as it is possible to convert the elements we're copying to the
  element type of the container we are initializing.
