See bottom of page 331:

REQUIREMENTS ON ITERATORS FORMING AN ITERATOR RANGE
---------------------------------------------------
Two iterators, begin and end, form an iterator range, if

  * They refer to elements of, or one past the end of, the same container, and

  * It is possible to reach end by repeatedly incrementing begin.  In other
    words, end must not precede begin.

Note that the compiler cannot enforce these requirements.  It is up to us to
ensure that our programs follow these conventions.
